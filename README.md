# What the project should do

1. Use compute instance to download data.
2. Send data from compute instance to GS Bucket.
3. Use PySpark to process and transform data.
4. Load transformed data into BigQuery.
5. Train an ML model using BigQuery ML.
6. Evaluate the model and make predictions.
7. Visualize resulting using Google Data Studio.
